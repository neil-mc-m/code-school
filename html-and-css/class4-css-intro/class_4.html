        <u>Nearly</u> ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step, but
        Privet Drive had hardly changed
        at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys&apos; front
        door; it crept into their
        living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful
        news report about the owls.
        Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots
        of pictures of what looked
        like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now
        the photographs showed a large
        blond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged
        and kissed by his mother.
        The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too. Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at
        the moment, but not for long.
        His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day. <em>"Up! Get up!
        Now!"</em> Harry woke with a
        start. His aunt rapped on the door again. <em>"Up!"</em> she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen
        and then the sound of the
        frying pan being put on the stove. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It
        had been a good one. There had
        been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he&apos;d had the same dream before. His aunt was back
        outside the door.
        <em>"Are you up yet?"</em> she demanded.
