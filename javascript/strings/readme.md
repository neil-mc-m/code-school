## javascript strings

  https://javascript.info/string


strings are a primitive type in javascript meaning they have no complex behaviour and are only capable of representing one value.

strings are wrapped in double quotes, single quotes or backticks

Strings have many built-in functions available:

[EXAMPLE]
```javascript
let myString = 'Dublin Coding School     ';
myString.trim(); // 'Dublin Coding School'
myString.indexOf('u'); // 1
myString.toUpperCase(); // 'DUBLIN CODING SCHOOL'
myString.length; // 25
```
and more.

mostly, we deal with string values when dealing with html form inputs

strings are similar to arrays in that the characters in the string are indexed, starting at zero.
